# Roman-Numerals


The problem
Write a class that implements the following interface:

public interface RomanNumeralGenerator {
   public String generate(int number); 
}

For example, see the following sample inputs and outputs: 
1 = “I” 
5 = “V” 
10 = “X” 
20 = “XX” 
3999 = “MMMCMXCIX”
Caveat: Only support numbers between 1 and 3999

com.bluecatcode.junit:junit-4.12-extended:1.0.4

All tests can now be run on the project. 

Once the project has been opened in an IDE, run main or run all tests and an out folder
will be created.
